	<meta property="og:description" content="We will open up participation in university institutions as a first step towards
this reform:

There will be an increase in evaluation questionnaires at all levels of
management and for all members of the university community. Participation will
be included in departments of quality and programmes of cooperation will be
implemented between university sectors and other educational centres and in
society as a whole.

We will encourage this cooperation within the system with the initiation of a
participative process for university reform, which associates the obtaining of
extra funding with the reaching of mutually agreed objectives.
In practice, as well as general funding derived from transfers to autonomous
regions, the State will provide complementary funding to support those
universities which work towards an increased social impact in its research and
which implant measure to improve the conditions of family conciliation, gender
equality, freedom of information and institutional democratization.

The strategy of each centre will be reviewed annually according to the
objectives agreed. These objectives should not necessarily be implemented in the
same way across the board, but can vary according to the needs of each
university." />
