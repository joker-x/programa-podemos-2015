	<meta property="og:description" content="We will design and implement a Rescue and Ecological Plan in Spain, over 20
years, with the intention of recovering the degraded areas and achieve a
recovery of the environment. This will involve the creation of sustainable
employment.

We will include a Plan of Biodiversity Conservation of our country. For this, we
will invest economically in the Fund for the Conservation of Biodiversity. We
will make an inventory of the natural system and we will strengthen information
systems such as the nature banks. On the other hand, we will include the
ecosystems not represented in the network of natural parks which also require
environment protection.

We will design systems that support the survival of large carnivores ( bears,
lynx and wolves) in their natural ecosystems and economic and human activities
(transport, ecotourism, livestock)

We will promote the prevention of exotic and invasive species in order to slow
their expansion

We will create ecological corridors, green infraestructures to restore moisture
cycles and mitigate the effects of the climate change." />
