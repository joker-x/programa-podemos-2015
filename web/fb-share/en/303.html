	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Animal Welfare Law" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will introduce an Animal Welfare Law which will include the following
actions:

 * Reduce VAT on veterinary services, which will stop being classified as luxury
   services and will instead be considered as essential services. This also
   takes into account the public health repercussions of these services.
 * Establish an Animal-Friendly City Award, similar to the blue flags awarded to
   beaches. This award will officially recognize any town that puts into
   practice the measures and services that are needed in order to guarantee the
   welfare of animals.
 * Review and regulate zoological parks and aquariums, taking into account
   animal welfare rather than thinking of them as leisure businesses.
 * Investigate all public shows where animals may be confined or ill-treated.
 * Stop all grants to animal shows that cannot guarantee their welfare.
   Likewise, we will modify the 18/2013 Law, of 12th November, which regulates
   bullfighting as a part of our national heritage." />
