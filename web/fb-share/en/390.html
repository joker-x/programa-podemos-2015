	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote a declaration of non-embargo and non-executable of the first and
only residence of permanent occupation. All housing used as only place of
residence and of permanent occupation will be declared as non-embargo and
non-executable property, except in the case of the voluntary renunciation of the
owner.

In the case of the death of the owner, the prohibition of embargo and
non-executability will be extended to family members with permanent occupation
in the home and who do not have alternative accommodation. Those included in the
definition of family members are those of direct descent or ascent of the
deceased owner.

The guarantee of non-embargo and non-execution will not be liable to opposition
with respect to debts which originate from the meeting other obligations – food,
taxes, contributions, expenses directly related to the home or obligations with
real guarantees related to the home and which would have constituted to have a
direct effect on the acquisition, construction or improvements to the home." />
