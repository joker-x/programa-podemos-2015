	<title>PODEMOS: Law for Autonomy and Dignity for dependent  people, their assistants and families</title>
	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Law for Autonomy and Dignity for dependent  people, their assistants and families" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="From a wide socio-political consensus to achieve a State Pact, we propose to
integrate and overcome the current laws about dependency, with the aim of taking
care of the huge diversity of life situations (children, adults with independent
life aspirations, the elderly, physical, sensorial and intellectual functional
diversity, etc). The new law will attempt to reduce or eliminate daily human
rights violations of people in dependent situations, severe economic
discrimination they may suffer along with their families, the standard of gender
inequality existent in the care economy, the hidden economy and labour
exploitation which have lead to the current situation.

This law will follow the Danish example. It will integrate the claims of the
Feminist Movement and Independent Life Movement and it will acknowledge the work
done both by the third sector and by the administration’s social service
professionals. Also, it will tend towards a personal assistance that fits
people’s needs and allows them to carry on with independent life projects in a
real and effective way; and also it will promote life schemes for people without
obliging them to leave their social environment. Its goal will be to protect,
and at the same time promote, the emancipation of people in dependent situations
as well as their current family carers, via a range of well funded public
services that specifically acknowledge their rights." />
