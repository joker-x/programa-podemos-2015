	<meta property="og:description" content="Based on the dual assumption that memory is a citizen’s right and that Spain has
not yet implemented a genuine public policy on memory, our project on democratic
memory and the culture of human rights is articulated around international law
in this area. According to the recommendations of the Special Reporter on Human
Rights Council of the UN that came to Spain in July 2014, our policy will be
based on the triad &#39;Memory, truth and justice&#34;. Therefore we will launch three
types of policies: Policies to right to memory orientated towards the guarantee
of non-repetition:

 * To promote the removal or redefinition of symbols and memorials of exaltation
   of the military uprising or of Franco.
 * To designing spaces of memory for educational purposes with a critical
   perspective.
 * to develop initiatives aimed at building a culture of human rights and the
   restoration of a pluralistic, democratic and collective memory in the
   education system of our country, in the training of civil servants and as
   included in and promoted by the media and other cultural areas.

Policies for the right to the truth:

 * To establish institutional mechanisms for the investigation and disclosure of
   the truth.
 * To ensuring access to public and private records as well as public and
   judicial investigations.
 * To promote the creation of institutions of memory.
 * To develop a comprehensive map of mass graves at the same time allowing for
   the future design of a comprehensive plan for exhumations.

Policies of access to justice for victims of the Franco regime:

 * To create a Secretary of State within the Presidential Ministries and an
   inter-ministerial agency which functions as a coordinating body.
 * To annul court judgments created during the civil war and the dictatorship.
 * To facilitate access to justice for victims of crimes against humanity.
 * To apply a universal jurisdiction on human rights provided for in our legal
