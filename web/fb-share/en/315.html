	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Right of asylum: legal entry channels, common asylum system and decent resettlement programmes" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote the adoption of a common system of real and effective asylum in
Europe to end the lack of homogeneity in the international protection of
refugees in the member countries, and the creation of a European Rescue Agency.

We will articulate safe and legal channels to recover the possibility of
requesting diplomatic asylum in Spanish embassies and consulates in third
countries and granting of humanitarian visas entry, elimination of transit visa
for those fleeing from countries in conflict and easing family reunification
processes.

In addition, we will create decent resettlement programmes to ensure a durable
solution and the commitment of Spain taking into account population and
resources factors.

We will approve, as urgent, the rules of Asylum Law, and review the system of
examination and admission of asylum applications, especially those made on the
basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, or any other reason related with
gender (violence, forced marriages, genital mutilation, etc.)." />
