	<meta property="og:description" content="We will supply the budgetary means to offer universal nursery education from 0
to 6 years of age which is free and of good quality and we will give this
educational stage the same recognition and conditions as other educational
stages. To this end we will prepare a specific plan of co-education in this
area, as a first step towards a non-sexist education, and to accompany the
demand of families and teachers with the object of developing their educational
skills and relation to children.

We will specially support families in vulnerable social situations, with
preventative measures of social intervention." />
