	<meta property="og:description" content="We will strengthen the professionalization of public administrations with the
adoption of a law regulating the following aspects:We will review public sector
pensions contracted over the last four years, based on reduced payments.

 * We will ensure the independence of people working in public administrations
   through the fair access, promotion and supply of jobs while applying
   constitutional principles such as equality, merit and ability.
 * We will put an end to the inflation of jobs directly appointed by
   politicians, known as freely appointed positions (PLD).
 * We will promote vertical and horizontal career development that combines the
   free choice to change jobs with concern for the technical resources of stable
   working teams.
 * Teams will consist of trained people with extensive professional experience
   that will not need to leave the position they currently hold in order to be
   promoted.
 * We will encourage horizontal internal promotion. Therefore, we will offer
   civil servants from different bodies but the same category the choice to
   alter their career path." />
