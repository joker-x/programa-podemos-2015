	<meta property="og:description" content="During the upcoming term of office we will promote a new agreement for the
financing of the regions, within the framework of a constitutional reform that
recognizes the dimension of our State as containing many nations. To this end,
we will carry out an evaluation of the different systems to finance the regions,
so that we can create a consensus on the reforms that are needed in order to
improve their efficacy in implementing effectively the fundamental principles of
autonomy, inter-territorial solidarity and institutional loyalty, all within the
framework of a federal Tax Office. We will also review the financing of local
and provincial tax systems, to ensure that they are capable of meeting the needs
of society as a whole." />
