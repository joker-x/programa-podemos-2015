	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: National Plan for Inclusive Education" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop a National Plan for Inclusive Education which recognizes the
diversity of students and guarantees their full integration both at compulsory
and post-compulsory levels.

 * The schooling of students with functional diversity will be carried out
   within ordinary schools, which will be provided with the material resources
   and personnel needed for their education.
 * The Special Education centres and their staff already in existence will be
   integrated into the network of ordinary schools and may be established as
   resource centres for special education.
 * The continuous training of teaching staff in innovating, inclusive teaching
   methods will be obligatory. Every year the funding of this service will be
   agreed depending on student numbers and their location.

Likewise, we will establish a new process of establishing teaching-pupil ratios
in the area of special education which takes into account not only the number of
pupils, but also their personal and family characteristics, those of the centre
and also the socio-demographic characteristics of the surrounding area. In the
last instance, the assigning of resources will be made taking into account the
criteria of the teaching professionals of each centre and in no circumstances
solely the criteria of the proportion of pupils with special needs." />
