	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Protection of the marine environment and its surroundings" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will revoke the amendments made to the Coastal Law and we will promote a new
model of coastal protection that takes into consideration geomorphological and
landscaping criteria.

We will develop a Strategic Marine Plan for the whole country, which will set
the basis for all human activities in the marine environment, and which will
favour the development of renewable energy sources and the protection of our
ecosystems.

We will continue to invest in the effective development of the EU Marine
Strategy Framework Directive.

We will include a sub programme in the National Scientific Research Programme,
aimed at promoting marine environment research, in order to promote the
development of marine renewable energy sources and the protection of the
environment.

We will encourage awareness of the Spanish protected marine areas and their
natural value, and we will include them in the national and regional strategies
for tourist promotion and environmental education.

We will increase the positive impact those areas can have on nearby coastal
communities. To that end, we will design specific labeling for the fish and
shellfish caught through non-destructive methods, allowed inside the reservation
area. We will work alongside with the different agents involved in order to
reduce the disposal of waste into the sea." />
