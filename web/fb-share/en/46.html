	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Reforming the IRPF (Personal Income Tax)" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="* We will reform personal income tax (IRPF) by increasing the type and number
   of bands for annual incomes of over 60,000 Euros.
 * We will increase the number of IRPF bands from 60,000 Euros and we will
   progressively lift the margins for each band, from the current 45% until it
   reaches 55% for annual incomes of over 300,000 Euros.
 * We will discontinue deductions that are regressive in character, since few
   tax payers benefit from them and those who do are mostly in the higher income
   brackets. The priority aim of fiscal benefits will be, in all cases, to
   protect the living conditions of individuals and families.
 * We will progressively correct the dual rate of income from work and from
   savings, and the lack of progression in the latter, in order to arrive at a
   single rate. The present situation creates vertical and horizontal
   inequality.
 * We will discontinue, in general, the system of objective assessment of
   financial matters since it generates opportunities to defraud on the one
   hand, and unjustifiable inequalities on the other. This regime makes no sense
   in a country such as Spain, where all companies, however small, are capable
   of keeping accounting records" />
