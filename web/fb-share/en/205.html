	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Law of Advanced Artistic Education" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="In coordination with the Higher Council of Artistic Studies and in line with the
demands of the educational community, we will act at national level to draft and
adopt a Law of Advanced Artistic Education and we will amend the relevant
education laws. Thanks to this, the specific teaching of these subjects will be
fully developed and achieved, while respecting their idiosyncrasies, overcoming
the current framework of qualification equivalence, to achieve full equality at
university education level in terms of their regulations of operational
structures, category, independence, autonomy, typology and denomination of
degrees offered (undergraduate, master’s and doctorate), the status of students
and the level of the organization and the remuneration system of teachers.

Also, we will set up procedures of continuous teacher training appropriate to
skills areas and to the most advanced level of these areas of teaching, and we
will connect lines of research development to the Spanish System of Science,
Technology and Innovation (SECTI) which allows for the creation of research
groups to develop projects of integrated research, innovation and creation
within art education colleges. We will eliminate incompatibilities and will
promote ways to support the development of artistic activity of college teaching
staff.

The new legislative framework favours the creation of Arts Universities, where
existing conservatories and colleges can be integrated. These will be fully
equated to the university criteria whilst respecting their specific field within
the European area of higher education, for which the particular characteristics
and requirements of artistic training will be taken into account." />
