	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Fines and administrative sanctions proportional to the income of the individuals" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will create a payment system of administrative sanctions and monetary fines
proportionate to the income of the sanctioned person. This will make the current
system fairer, proportional and more functional.

To do this, we will build on the following principles:

 * Accountability of the offending person.
 * Fulfilling the role of deterrence.
 * To fulfill this function, people with lower incomes must be able to pay their
   fines whilst there should be an equivalent impact on those with higher
   incomes.
 * Obligation to be fair. Proportional fines are inherently fairer, because the
   quantities are neither too low for some offenders nor so high as to exceed
   the capacity of others.

Establishment of a system of flexible and limited calculation starting from a
base rate and establishing different thresholds similar to those fixed for the
payment of income tax." />
