	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote a public and external auditing of the judicial system in order
to gain a clear picture of the current situation. The audit will be based on
criteria such as efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. We will also
evaluate necessary reorganization in areas that need strengthening, so that
parameters for the optimisation of resources are established.

Moreover, we will create a judicial office equipped with the means to develop
more efficient performance which is closer to citizens, embodying a true public
service. This office will receive direct state funding (central government will
take on local responsibility in this area). It will be under the control of the
Ministry of Justice and will have capabilities for the transfer of publicly
owned buildings. It will control electronic record-keeping and will digitalize
the entire judicial system." />
