	<meta property="og:description" content="* We will increase the number of designated protected areas along our coast.
 * We will compile a list of town halls that implement best practices on their
   coastline, in order to publicize them and acknowledge their value and
   commitment to sustainability. In this way, they will be an example to be
   followed by others.
 * We will develop a Coast, Wetlands, Marshes, Beaches and Eroded Areas
   Ecological Restoration Plan.
 * We will set up new water treatment plants and improve existing ones, in order
   to reduce the volume of effluent along the coast, and improve its condition.
   Furthermore, we will keep an effluent record, intensify our vigilance on
   effluent from shipping and implement improved protocols in order to make it
   less likely to occur, particularly in the coastal areas of Spain where marine
   traffic is most intense." />
