	<meta property="og:description" content="* We will support adoption in LGBTI families
 * We will modify laws, official documentation and public administration
   questionnaires so that they reflect all family circumstances without
   exceptions.
 * We will ensure that women in a lesbian couple relationship will not be
   required to provide a Declaration of Paternity in order to become mothers.

We will guarantee the acknowledgment of parentage for lesbian couples so that
they can have maternity conditions equal to those of heterosexual couples.
Therefore, we will remove any extra requirements that are currently needed to
register a birth in these cases." />
