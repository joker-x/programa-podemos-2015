	<title>PODEMOS: Redefinition of the military career for all professional members of the Army</title>
	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Redefinition of the military career for all professional members of the Army" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will fully reform the Military Career Law 39/2007 (19th November) to include
troop and navy staff and temporary officers; and we will also end current
temporary commitments.

We will prioritize the establishment of a promotion system based solely on
objective criteria and sustained by the principles of equality, merit and
capability.

In this way, professional experience will be valued and current subjective
assessment criteria (such as personal qualification reports) will be suppressed
and current age limits will be eliminated.

With the experience gained from the first few graduations within the new
military educational system, a study will be undertaken in order to complete the
adaptation of this system to the general educational system.

We will carry out a comprehensive plan for social action based on equality that
will pay special attention to families and will eliminate privileges." />
