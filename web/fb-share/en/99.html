companies with more than one hundred employees either by the strengthening of
procedures of information and consultation established in the worker’s statute
or by the implementation of a system similar to German supervisory boards.
Furthermore, we will put forward a law, which will be voluntary for companies,
to enable the financial involvement of workers. This law will enable the
incorporation of some of the best experiences of workers’ involvement in other
European countries." />
