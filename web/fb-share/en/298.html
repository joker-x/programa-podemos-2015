	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Connecting territories and encouraging the use of rail" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will improve rail accessibility since it is the safest and the most
sustainable of the all modes of public transport and we will encourage its use
as a transport for passengers for medium and long distance routes. We will
improve lines, accessibility, frequency and rolling stock.

We will promote the transport of goods by rail as an alternative to the road
transport when the distance is greater than 400 kilometers. In this way we will
reduce the environmental impact. We will improve the high speed train network,
after neccessary analysis and technical studies, and we will convert some
sections of lower-speed lines which have greater use, with more stops along the
route. We will also guarantee a network which is not simply radial, in order to
achieve greater access to railway system and provide more fair and balanced
mobility through our territory." />
