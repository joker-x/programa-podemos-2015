	<meta property="og:description" content="We will deploy a set of measures which can promote the right of citizens to
participate in cultural life (Articles 9.2 and 44.1 of the Spanish Constitution)
by promoting tools for knowledge, dissemination, participation and access. In
promoting access to culture, this will becomes a real experience of enjoyment
and criticism. In the case of heritage, its conservation, research and
dissemination guarantee that knowledge survives. The creation of new audiences
and readers, strengthening the usual and increasing participation in cultural
events are challenges connected with the existence of a democratic and active
citizenship. For the consolidation of a stable and sustainable cultural fabric a
broader, more involved and more loyal audience is also key. Among other
measures, in coordination with the Operational Plan for a Reading Citizenship
and the Spectators’ School, this plan will cover:

 * Support for libraries from the social perspective (public and school) and
   scientific (academic and heritage), stimulating the purchase of new
   materials, with the creation of a public platform for e-book lending and the
   modernization of its equipment.
 * The increased presence of cultural content in all channels broadcasted by
   RTVE, with a pluralistic approach to promote awareness of the cultural and
   linguistic diversity of all regions. A specifically cultural character will
   be given to Spanish nation channel two (La 2 RTVE) which will encourage the
   knowledge of artistic creation and the inclusion of specific content tailored
   to different regions. Along the same lines, we will promote connections and
   collaboration with the European cultural channel Arte, as well as other
   international distribution and production channels.
 * The promotion of the distribution of varied stage productions through the
   revitalization, adaptation and update of networks and exhibition spaces
   throughout our country.
 * The update and optimization of resources and initiatives, among others, the
   National Musical Broadcasting Centre and Theatrical Documentation Centre.
 * In conversation with the educational community, increasing subjects related
   to culture and to the variety of artistic practices, creativity and knowledge
   and visual, audiovisual, musical and stage skills for inclusion in formal
   education (infant, primary and secondary school).
 * The development of initiatives aimed at promoting associations and amateur
   groups of different artistic disciplines." />
