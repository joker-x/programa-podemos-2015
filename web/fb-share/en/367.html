	<meta property="og:description" content="We will set in place an investment and action plan along with Portugal to
promote communications and joint investments.

Extremadura and the Portuguese area of Alentejo share a border, but also have
similar socio-economic characteristics and low population density, a lack of
communication and transport, and dependency on farming and cattle livestock. For
this reason we will promote a change in the production model of both regions, as
sharing services and infrastructures is a common goal that requires, as well as
specific cooperation, the joint design of projects and a strong commitment to
investments." />
