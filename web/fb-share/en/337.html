	<meta property="og:description" content="We will create a new Ministry of Equality and Solidarity, who will be
responsible for implementing the policy of cooperation and international
solidarity organization.

The inter-ministerial dialogue level will be high and will be responsible for
the planning, management and implementation of all actions on international
cooperation for development (politics of solidarity and cooperation,
humanitarian aid, education for global citizenship, research for global justice,
sustainable development, etc.), including the management of its financial
instruments (ODA), refundable or not, and action for global economic justice. It
will, also, ensure coherence on politics for development through an unit with a
capacity of analysis, evaluation and audit of all public policies.

In addition, we will implement a new career to train professionals in
international cooperation and solidarity, which will be explicitly, functionally
and organically differentiated of the diplomatic service." />
