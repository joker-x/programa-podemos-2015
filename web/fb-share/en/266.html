shall be set in motion, in order to simplify procedures, minimize bureaucratic
burdens, and even out the procedures, through the following actions and
measures:

 * Simplifying and reducing administrative burdens and implanting homogeneity in
   the procedures.
 * Consolidating a real digitalized administration to allow citizens to go
   through any kind of procedure more quickly and easily at any time, and from
   any place, thanks to a single virtual desk. This way, there will be no need
   to provide documents that are already digitalized.
 * Full Incorporation of new technology to administrative procedures.
 * Progressing towards the overcoming of the digital breach present in our
   society.
 * Guaranteed access to permanent counseling points, both online and in person,
   that should also facilitate the process of obtaining a digital certificate,
   when requested." />
