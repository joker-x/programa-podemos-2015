	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote improvements in the evaluation system of teaching and research,
to ensure innovation and autonomy at all levels in research and education.

We will change the old pyramidal hierarchy structure where contracts are given
(and terminated) by the State, and move instead towards a meritocratic
governance model where those responsible for managing the contracts are held
accountable for their results before Parliament, the group of people under
contract, and before society at large." />
