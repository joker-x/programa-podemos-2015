	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: End of precariousness employment for university teachers" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="The reduction of substitution fees (first by 10% and then by 50%) have been a
decisive blow against the quality of university education. In order to resolve
this dramatic present situation, we will recover a teaching staff that is
sufficient and we will bring an end to precariousness so that educational
quality is not affected:

We will reduce the teacher/student ratio from the present 13 to 1 to 10 to 1 by
the end of the term of office.

We will establish by law the maximum percentage of associated teachers that can
exist in a university (10%) with special treatment for medical degrees whose
associates are of a specific nature.

We will increase the fee for substitution immediately and unconditionally in
order to compensate for losses to teaching staff in recent years. The rate will
never be less than 100%.

We will promote partial voluntary retirement amongst staff over the age of
sixty, so that efforts can be made to rejuvenate staff without the loss of
accumulated experience (Late Career Fellowship)" />
