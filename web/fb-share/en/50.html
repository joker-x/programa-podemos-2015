	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Establishing a true green fiscal system" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will establish a green fiscal system which will act as a disincentive to the
use of contaminating energy sources and as an incentive to energy efficiency and
the use of renewable energies, and we will propose the convergence of the
Spanish environmental tax rate (1,6% of GDP) with the European Union average
(2,4% of GDP). To achieve this, we will:

 * Reform taxes on hydrocarbons and coal and, in particular, revise current
   fiscal benefits.
 * Apply a tax exemption on renewable electricity production installations of
   under 100 kilowatts.
 * Equalise rates imposed on petrol and diesel.
 * Reform mechanical traction vehicle taxes to take into consideration their
   contaminating characteristics.
 * Study the possibility of imposing taxes according to the specific use of
   certain transport infrastructures.
 * Explore the possibility of applying a congestion tax in certain cities in
   order to provide an incentive to use public transport.
 * Establish a minimum price on CO2 emission rights." />
