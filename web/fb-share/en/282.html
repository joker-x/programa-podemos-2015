	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: New Water Law" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We believe water is a common good, and so a participative decision-making
process is necessary when it comes to its management and distribution.

We will develop a Water Law in accordance with the Water Framework Directive to
guarantee access to quality water as a right and, also, to maintain the
ecological systems, rivers, aquifers and other bodies of water in good
condition.

We will democratize the river basin management bodies by incorporating those
sectors that have been so far excluded from management and decision-making
bodies, such as the organizations that advocate for sustainable use of water and
the conservation of rivers.

We will revise Hydrologic Programs in order to guarantee their full coherence
with the Water Framework Directive, and also to make them more efficient in
achieving and maintaining good ecological conditions.

We will sponsor the prevention of floods and we will guarantee the correct
management of territories around waterways and their floodable areas, according
to the Flood Risk Management Directive." />
