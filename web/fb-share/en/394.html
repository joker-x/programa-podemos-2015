precept which guarantees universal, egalitarian, free, quality public health
care for all citizens irrespective of the area of residence.

The law will include the obligation to allocate state funds to sufficiently
co-finance the infrastructures and means necessary with the aim of correcting
the inequality in the area of health care, and to fulfil human and
constitutional rights, as well as currently valid laws and rulings.

The co-funding of hospitals and centres of specialized attention has to be a
priority in peripheral districts which are more than thirty minutes away by road
to an assigned hospital.

It is also essential that regional responsibilities in the area of health are
coordinated and that the obligation exists to establish agreements about health
care which facilitate the complete attention of neighbouring populations,
especially in the case of those patients who need speedy and effective
assistance.

It will also be possible to choose a medical centre on groups of access or
proximity, irrespective of one’s region of residence, for both out-patient and
in-patient treatment." />
