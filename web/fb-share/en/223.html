	<title>PODEMOS: Operational Plan for Internationalization of Culture Produced in Spain</title>
	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Operational Plan for Internationalization of Culture Produced in Spain" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="The internationalization of culture will be an important axis of action within
the strategy of making culture a tool of social cohesion and international
cooperation and an engine for the economy, viewing different geographical areas
not only as niche markets, but also as cultural areas of high social interest.
If we share the cultural diversity of Spain abroad we will achieve different
objectives:

 * to communicate the fact that Spain is an important centre of cultural
   creation.
 * to increase the exchange of knowledge and experiences between cultural
   operators.
 * to increase the visibility and influence of our culture abroad and
   encouraging its access and consumption.
 * to attract foreign investments into cultural projects that arise and develop
   in Spain.

To support cultural professionals, associations, cooperatives and companies in
their internationalization efforts and disseminate this cultural reality, we
will launch a mediation office that will operate under the name &#34;EsCultura&#34;.
Under this label, the office will establish a coordinated and common action plan
to assist cultural agents from all fields of artistic expressions and to
facilitate access to funds and foreign grants, which will seek to ensure their
continued presence in international cultural forums. We will favour the
extension overseas of small, medium and large projects, representative of the
rich and diverse cultural fabric of our country, through exchanges,
scholarships, touring production of events, festivals, exhibitions, meetings,
presentations and technological clusters.

As a mediation office, “EsCultura” will foster the coordination of cultural
activities currently carried out by very different organizations: Instituto
Cervantes, Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development (AECID),
Spanish Cultural Action, Institut Ramon Llull, Institut d &#39; Baleàrics Studies,
Ministry of Industry, Spanish Foreign Trade Institute, cultural centres in
Spain, Spanish embassies abroad and Carolina Foundation." />
