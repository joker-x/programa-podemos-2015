	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Direct election of the General Council of the Judiciary" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We believe that, although the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) maintains
its current general competences, it must also directly assume its primary
function: to ensure the independence of the judiciary power as a public service.

To this end, we propose the following measures:

 * To establish the direct election by the citizens of the fifteen members of
   the CGPJ, who will be chosen from among judges, prosecutors, court clerks and
   lawyers of recognized standing with at least ten years of professional
   experience and also their endorsement by associations, trade unions or civil
   platforms.
 * To institutionally regulate and promote these elections by a collegial body
   created for this purpose by Congress.
 * To set spending limits on the campaigns for these elections." />
