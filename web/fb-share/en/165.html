	<meta property="og:description" content="Physical Education is essential for the creation of independent citizens with a
healthy and active lifestyle. PISA reports point out the existence of a direct
relationship between academic outcomes and the percentage of school time devoted
to Physical Education. Moreover, various studies support the relation between
child obesity and sedentary behaviour.

We will promote a change in the Educational Law so that, among other measures,
it reinstates Physical Education as a compulsory subject as was the case before
the LOMCE educational law. Moreover, we will adapt the number of school hours
devoted to Physical Education to the EU average. This means an increase of three
hours per week of this subject in primary and secondary schools. Furthermore, in
order to preserve the specific importance of Physical Education throughout
secondary schooling, we will reinstate the subject of Physical Education in the
final year curriculum." />
