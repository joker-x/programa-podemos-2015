	<meta property="og:description" content="We defend the right to self-determination of the Saharawi people. Therefore, we
will assume a more active role in the UN Security Council and demand to review
the general framework of the negotiating process to reinforce the mandate of the
UN mediation and to enable the Security Council to punish those countries that
obstruct the political process. In addition, we will argue for the contribution
of the United Nations Mission for Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) to the
supervision of the human rights respect and defence and the organization of
official visits on the ground, both in Western Sahara and in the Tindouf refugee
camps.

Also, we will increase humanitarian aid to the Saharawi camps, support
programmes of training and mobility of the Saharawi people and will encourage
access to Spanish nationality of Saharawi people living in our country with the
same rights as other people in the same situation.

Finally, we will advocate the appointment of a European Union Special
Representative for Western Sahara who will have regular monitoring of conflict
resolution at the European Union level." />
