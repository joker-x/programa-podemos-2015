	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Lowering the teacher-student ratio" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will advocate the lowering of student ratio per class to return to the
situation prior to 2008 with a maximum of 8, 12 or 16 pupils in the first cycle
and a maximum of 20 pupils in the second cycle. We will work towards a gradual
approximation to the recommendations made by the European Early Childhood
Education and Care Commission, la Red de Atención a la Infancia de la Comisión
Europea: 25 pupils in primary and secondary, 30 pupils in Baccalaureate, 15
pupils in basic professional training and 25 pupils in intermediate and advanced
professional training.

We will recover as soon as possible ratios to open and close rural schools – 5
to open them and 3 to close them.

We will apply reducing coefficients according to the number of pupils with
special educational needs present in the classroom.

We will reduce the number of teaching contact hours with allowing for quality
teaching which includes within the teaching timetable the necessary time for
team coordination, for research and reflexion about teaching practice." />
