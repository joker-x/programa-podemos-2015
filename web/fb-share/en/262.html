	<meta property="og:description" content="We will create a State Agency for Consumer Protection. This agency will act as
an autonomous and neutral regulator with sanctioning powers. It will have a
dedicated body of inspectors who will conduct investigations on their own
initiative and evaluate complaints brought by the regional authorities and
consumer associations, in addition to exchanging information with other
government agencies about irregularities detected in the market. The
organizations involved in consumer protection will be considered an interested
party in proceedings that are opened because of their complaints or when
appearing on behalf of those affected. Also, we will review the disciplinary
framework set out in the legislation affecting the protection of consumers,
making sure that fines are actually proportionate to the gravity of offences,
and providing for the forfeiture of up to ten times the amount of the benefits
that were gained by businesses as a result of fraudulent practices." />
