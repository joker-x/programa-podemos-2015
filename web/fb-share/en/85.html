	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote reform of the European institutions to democratise political and
economic decisions in the Eurozone. The economic government of the Eurozone -the
Eurogroup- is an entity that is not required to be accountable to any
institution directly elected by citizens, not even the European Parliament.
Therefore we will support the creation of a parliamentary chamber in the
Eurozone, made up of representatives from the different national parliaments
according to demographic and territorial criteria, which will have, unlike the
European Parliament, real legislative power and political control." />
