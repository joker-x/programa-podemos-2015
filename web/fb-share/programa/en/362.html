	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Railway to Castilla y Leon" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="Castilla y Leon is a very extensive region with significant lacks in
communications between its provinces, districts and villages. Therefore, we will
study access and connections to improve mobility and accessibility between this
region and others as well as internal communication between provinces within the
region.

The measures we will set in place will work towards the following goals:

 * To promote both a conventional and commuter train system.
 * To promote the transportation of merchandise by rail. Spain is one of the
   countries in Europe with the lowest rates in this kind of transportation.
 * To reopen the section between Madrid-Aranda del Duero and Burgos.
 * To reopen the section of Via de la Plata (Zamora-Salamanca-Plasencia) and its
   continuation towards Asturias through Benavente. We will evaluate a new
   direct section from Benavente to Leon.
 * We will recover the project of the Madrid-Plasencia line known as &#34;the cherry
   train&#34;." />
