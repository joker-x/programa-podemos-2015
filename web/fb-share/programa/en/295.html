	<meta property="og:description" content="We will guarantee the application of the current Regulation of Sustainable
Development for the Rural Areas, from 13th December 2007, and the Royal Decree
752 / 2010 in order to reverse the tendency to depopulation and abandonment of
the rural areas and also to encourage coordination between administrations.

We will develop a Comprehensive Participatory Plan by Regions (which until now
has been paralysed by the Government) under the parameters of Social and
Environmental Sustainability. We will create a new institutional framework which
leads to the democratization of local administration and the recognition of
self-government, which improves its responsibilities, with the objective of
balancing the precarious institutional loyalty to the three existing levels of
the government." />
