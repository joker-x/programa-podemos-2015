	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Water: a human right" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will take different measures for the detection and eradication of water
poverty and we will recognise water as a human right. As water is a human right,
we will guarantee a minimum amount for each citizen to cover their basic needs.

We will revise construction projects of the large water infrastructures (dams
and diverting canals) and we will develop alternative systems of supply for
periods of water shortage. In the areas that will profit from these water
diversions, the key elements in this transition to a more sustainability future
are the management of agrarian, urban and industrial demands, and also the
optimisation of non-conventional resources (the reuse of the residual waters and
marine desalination).

We will implement an ambitious programme of public investment in order to
provide all towns with residual water treatment systems. In this way, we will
comply with the obligations from Directive 91 / 271 of Residual Waters and will
also avoid penalties from the European Union that were imposed as a result of
the abandonment in these matters by previous governments." />
