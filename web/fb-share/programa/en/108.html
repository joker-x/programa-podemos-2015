the pension reform approved during the PP term of office in 2014, thereby
returning pensions to the consumer price index (IPC), in order to guarantee the
level of purchasing power of retired people. To achieve this, the Spanish
statutory law 23/2013, 13th December, which regulates the sustainability and the
revaluation index of the Social Security pension system will be repealed." />
