	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Against sexist violence, the independence of women" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will ensure independence for women. A person can only end a violent situation
if she is independent and, therefore, has alternatives. We will modify the Law
on Gender Violence so that women are conceived as active subjects and not as
victims. We will also include all the types of sexist violence as explained by
the Istanbul Convention: forced marriage, “honour” crimes, human trafficking of
women and children, feminine genital mutilation, etc. Moreover, we will
elaborate psycho-social intervention plans aimed at men convicted of sexist
violence, and we will strengthen measures for sexist violence prevention through
campaigns aimed at the adolescent population to prevent sexist behaviour. We
will also work on increasing awareness and involvement in the whole of society,
but especially in men.

We will also establish protection and support services specializing in minors
exposed to sexist violence to guarantee their safety.

We will guarantee an immediate accommodation alternative for victims of sexist
violence and urgent access to allowances without the need of a previous report.

We will carry out an employment plan for women over forty-five and women in risk
of social exclusion." />
