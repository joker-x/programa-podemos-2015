will develop an online research website which will publish all project offers,
collaboration agreements and calls to tender of all types, including contracts
and jobs undertaken by public research institutions.

The portal will list all R&amp;D public projects for tender in a biannual calendar,
which must be complied with and agreed by the Government, the regions and other
state-funded agencies.

It will also have an open access database that includes researchers&#39; profiles,
research groups, universities, PRIs and research projects at national level.

It will collect and make public all the statistical information contained in the
Sistema Español de Ciencia, Technología e Innovación (SECTI): number of male and
female students, budgets, projects, etc." />
