	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Action plan for the dignity of people in dependent situation and their families" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="During the first hundred days in government and within the current legal
framework, the following measures will be adopted with the sole purpose of
alleviating the material emergency in which hundreds of thousands of dependent
people and their families currently live:

To abolish the Royal Decree 20 / 2012 that has reduced the effective rights and
funding of the Autonomous Regions by the national administration.

To recover the agreed funding level and the 13% minimum funding level. This can
be done by basing the Dependency Law on the actual cost of the services
delivered or the allowances granted and it will be divided between the state
general administration (50%) and the autonomous regions (50%) therefore
abolishing the co-payment of services by the general public. Once this system
has been fully established, the funding will be effected through the Statutory
Law of Autonomous Regional Funding (LOFCA in Spanish).

To abolish the “dependency limbo” which affects more than 433,000 people and to
demand the fulfilment of the six months procedural clause so that everyone who
has been recognised as entitled to receive an allowance or service will be
included in the Individual Attention Plan (PIA in Spanish) and will receive it.

To guarantee a sufficient personal assistance in PIA and the right of every
adult to an independent life plan in every autonomous region." />
