	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Maternal single-parent families: for independent and secure maternity" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will initiate the measures to guarantee the protection of single mother
families with children in their care:

 * For those currently receiving benefits, we will increase Social Security
   benefits per child in care, up to 150 Euros per month, in the case of
   single-parent families.
 * We will create a non-contributory maternity benefit for mothers without
   resources who are actively seeking employment
 * We guarantee the protection of children from evictions.
 * We will consider the single parent family unit from the birth of the first
   child as a family situation of particular vulnerability. Therefore, we will
   increase their protection against evictions; we will facilitate the
   possibility of restructuring mortgage debt first as a priority, and we will
   extend the protection of vulnerable children in terms of relocation, to
   assure decent alternative housing before eviction takes place." />
