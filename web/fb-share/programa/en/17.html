	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop a National Pact for a Productive Economy capable of promoting
multilateral agreement between government, businesses and unions for industrial
development, to turn the centre of gravity from financial logic to productive
logic. So we will focus on productive investment as the centre of industrial
priorities and the creation of medium and long term wealth, as opposed to the
logic of maximizing share values generated through business management.

In any case, re-industrialization cannot be based on a focus on competiveness
through prices, since when everything relies only on the reduction of labour
costs and on the containment of domestic demand, it consolidates inadequate
specialization unable to generate quality employment and decent salaries." />
