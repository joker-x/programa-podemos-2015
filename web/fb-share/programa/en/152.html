	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Education throughout life: adult education" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will increase the number of state educational centres which offer night
classes, distance classes and classes for adults.

We will recover convenient, flexible timetables for teaching in Adult Teaching
Centres (CEPA) in order to encourage learning throughout life and the
reconciliation of family and work commitments. And we will recover
psycho-pedagogic support in the adult centres to be coordinated with local
social agents.

We will prepare a Plan for Adult Education in a participative way, to include
technological literacy and languages, depending on demand. With this plan we
will recover staff according to real educational needs. All of this will be
carried out with the intention of guaranteeing the cooperation and coordination
in adult education of local authorities via an Adhesion Charter in order to
promote joint work which is aimed at the needs of the local population." />
