	<meta property="og:description" content="We will implement the Citizen Observatory of Public Policy Evaluation and
Accountability with two main objectives:

 * To make appropriate use of evaluation in the service of general interest.
   
   
 * To link the evaluation to the budget cycle, in such a way that it becomes an
   instrument of expression of a culture of assessment and accountability.
   
   
 * We will provide the right to intervene or to form part of the Citizen
   Observatory of Public Policy Evaluation and Accountability to any person or
   group affected by national legislation or public administration proceedings.
   As a preliminary to the annual budget debate, public officials responsible
   for each sector should submit a report to the observatory on the degree of
   implementation and execution of the relevant policy.
   
   
 * Budget debates will feed into a collective knowledge generated within the
   observatory. Most members of Parliament will be provided with a level of
   information vastly superior to that currently available to them" />
