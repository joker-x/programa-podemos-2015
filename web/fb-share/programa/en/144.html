centre, should be the body which elects the head teacher, participates in the
overall educational project and will support their decision for improvement.
Such participation on the part of school councils will constitute the best
guarantee of democratic participation throughout the educational community.

The school councils will draw up the regulations for each centre with the
participation of the educational community and will be subject to totally
independent educational inspection." />
