Environmental Education with the intention of letting citizens participate in
environmental issues that affect our well-being. For this purpose, we will
encourage different ways of citizens’ participation and cooperation. By this

group identity and that will encourage active involvement in the cooperative
construction of an environmentally responsible model of human and social
development. This strategy considers:

 * Guaranteeing the application of information, transparency and participation
   principles in Government activities.

   life cycles with the purpose of actively raising awareness and get people
   involved in the environmental issues." />
