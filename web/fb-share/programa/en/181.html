Diversity. It will meet periodically and, although it will receive a regular
allowance from State, its functioning will be independent, open, transparent and
democratic. We intend to include in this forum companies as well as foundations
and associations from the third sector related to dependency and functional
diversity (such as social movements, citizens and families not belonging to any
formal social group but affected by this issue). The goal of this forum will be
to discuss, analyse, inform and propose legislation and public policies in the
area of dependency and functional diversity, with the acknowledgement and
consent of the civil society involved, without excluding the possibility of
binding procedural decisions on those subjects of major relevance." />
