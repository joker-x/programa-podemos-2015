	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Establishment of mechanisms and organisations that allow for the return of Spanish emigrants" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will set in motion a series of mechanisms and organizations that allow for
the return of Spanish emigrants based on a study of the reality of Spanish
emigration, revealing its causes and sociological characteristics. In this way
we will be able to put in place an appropriate policy for returned emigrants.

In order to do this, the involvement of the local administrations and the
Emigration Office will be required, as a means of exchanging information and
assistance in easing the return process. Moreover, work experience abroad as
well as studies and language certificates by foreign official institutions
should be recognized when accessing public employment. Furthermore, we will
enhance the current system of contributions for the recognition of years
contributed in countries belonging to the European Union, and will equate the
rights of emigrants to those of the rest of Spaniards regarding social services
(for example, public housing)." />
