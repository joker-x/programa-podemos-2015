	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Increase and facilitating of allowances for orthoprosthetic materials" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="Many of the people in situations of dependency or with functional diversity need
expensive orthoprosthetic material (such as wheelchairs, corsets or cochlear
implants) in order to increase their functionality and live a full life. We
propose to change the subsidy system starting with the following measures:

To increase the amounts subsidised so that people with low economic resources
are not forced to choose low quality materials as it is currently happening.

To standardize allowances throughout autonomous regions.

To allow the administration to advance money after the approval and submission
of a pro-forma invoice or similar, so that people with fewer resources are not
forced to pay out the amount and wait for its refund.

To speed up the process of granting of subsidies and, particularly, grant the
request of urgent treatment by a specialist when a report is needed.

To pay the debts currently accumulated in the system as soon as possible." />
