 * We will encourage the establishment of a single academic career for
   universities and for public research Institutions (PRIs) by unifying
   contracting procedures, evaluation and academic merit criteria.
 * We will set up a professional career to cover investigation work in
   laboratories and in R&amp;D
 * We will establish a clinical research career that is unrelated to teaching
   and reflects the idiosyncrasies of the clinical environment.
 * We will review the salary scales associated with a career in research that
   takes into account the responsibilities of each stage and the European
   average.
 * We will introduce measures to ameliorate existing gender inequality, which
   worsens in the fiend of research as one progresses through the different
