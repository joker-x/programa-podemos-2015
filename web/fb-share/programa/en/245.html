be avoided including as a result of the removal of &#34;uncomfortable&#34; agents. These
police units must meet the following requirements:

 * To be temporarily, functionally assigned to courts or tribunals.
 * To have an independent structure and a very small number of freely appointed
   positions.
 * To be made up of officials with proven experience in the Judicial Police, and
   with exclusive access via a specific competitive examination.

To promote and conduct investigation on open court cases:

 * They will be delegated by the judge or prosecutor within the judiciary.
 * They may requisition from the police all the personal and material means
   needed bring the investigation to a successful conclusion.
 * They will not be required to report on the developments of their
   investigation or on its results." />
