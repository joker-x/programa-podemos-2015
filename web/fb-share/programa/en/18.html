	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Support of clusters to reverse the process of deindustrialization" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will reverse the process of deindustrialization, promote a new productive
diversification and strengthen an innovative production network focused on the
development of SMEs, identifying those emerging sectors connected to network
industries.

Clusters, defined as basic instruments of cooperation among the most dynamic
companies in a sector and public administrations, research institutions and
universities should become useful tools to extend good practices, encourage
innovation and improve overall productivity of companies in the sector. For this
reason, we will promote a new connection between global and local spheres by
promoting existing industrial clusters, their relationship with regional
development platforms and the extension of good practices that already exist in
some of them." />
