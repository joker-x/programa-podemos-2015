	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: A National Agreement for Science and Innovation" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="Science and innovation policy must be considered a State matter. A wide-ranging
agreement will be sought between all social actors and agents in order to take
responsibility and propose future improvements in a coordinated manner, arrived
at by consensus and independent of political change.

A Science and Innovation Board will be established to implement the agreement.

We will seek to get a commitment from companies to appoint staff under contract
as oppose to focusing on short-term financial gains; from financial partners, a
commitment to offer the necessary loans to finance scientific activities, and
from the researchers, a commitment to facilitate the transfer of knowledge." />
