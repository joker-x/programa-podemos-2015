	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Public, free, universal and high quality early assistance and intervention" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="Development disorders or the risk of suffering from them are health issues.
Therefore, all funding of early assistance and intervention should be included
in the National Health Service list of services to guarantee their free and high
quality universality,

Early assistance and intervention should be provided directly in public centres
of the state health system network or by non-profit making organizations with
proven experience, and under no circumstances by private entities.

Therefore, we will write and approve the Early Attention National Law for
infancy that guarantees dialogue, involvement and participation of families;
interdisciplinary and high professional qualifications; coordination between
those professionals involved in health, social and education services (each with
specific and supporting but never excluding activities); decentralisation, so
that close access for families is provided, including home visits and
coordination with health services and schools; and finally the balancing of
habitat and demand with the good functioning of Early Infancy Attention Centres." />
