	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: University fees which are accessible to all" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="It is impossible to conceive a deep transformation of society without the
prominent role of universities. With our proposal we wish to create the
conditions which encourage the essential synergy between the scientific and
teaching effort carried out in universities and an improvement in the lives of
everyone in our country.

To this end we propose:

To guarantee universal access at any level to advanced studies, by means of a
reduction in fees and an increase in grants, so that no one is excluded for
socio-economic reasons.

The social commitment of universities will be fundamental as will be the scheme
of qualifications and Research and Development which works along the lines of
teaching and research orientated towards the well-being of people and with the
potential to generate a response within society as a whole.

We will encourage coordination between regions and state as well as the
cooperation of secondary and professional training centres." />
