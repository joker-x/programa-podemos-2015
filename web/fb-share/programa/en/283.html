	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: The principle of “the polluter pays”" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will immediately repeal the 11/2014 Law, and the 183/2015 Royal Decree which
amends the 26/2007 Environmental Responsibility Law, that has precaution,
prevention and the “polluter pays” principle as key points.

We will simplify administrative proceedings by establishing a single
environmental license which will cover all kinds of environmental impact
factors, and this way, we will provide the operators with a single
administrative entity with which to communicate.

We will undertake a relocation process of stations for the control and measuring
of industrial pollution, and those areas that will guarantee the maximum level
of protection of the population, always within mandatory control parameters.

We will promote the development of R+D+I in those technologies for the
prevention of pollution and decontamination, especially in relation to soil, and
also for environmental recovery in case of an environmental catastrophe.

We will encourage adaptation to new available knowledge especially regarding the
effect of pollutants on people’s health.

We will introduce an Environmental Risks Technician Training Plan to provide
support to the industrial activity and also the national administration as the
main controlling entity.

We will prioritize the application of the “polluter pays” principle by promoting
real environmental responsibility among the main extractors of natural
resources, through a financial guarantee policy for the repair of the
environment, depending on the possible damages to be incurred." />
