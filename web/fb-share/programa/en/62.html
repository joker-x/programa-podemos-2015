	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Restructuring of public debt" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will restructure public debt linked to state aid to the financial sector,
memorandum of understanding and the bail-out of the European Union. In paying
back the 60,000 million Euros provided by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)
to Spain in 2012 to bail-out the financial system, the financial institutions
themselves will participate once they have recapitalized and have received other
support to ensure their stability. It should be these entities which are
ultimately responsible for the loan advanced by the European Union, so far being
financed by Spanish taxpayers.

The restructuring of this debt will be focused not so much on a reduction of
repayment periods or agreed interest rates, but the redefinition of the final
payers of the bill. As noted in the section on taxation, financial institutions
will bear a temporary &#34;solidarity tax&#34; to channel the repayment of loaned funds." />
