	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Citizen participation in public administration" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will establish participation mechanisms within public administrations in
order to bring public management into the public domain. This will be based on
the principles of value and the common good, so that citizens can contribute to
improving public services.

We will promote the following broad-based measures in public administration:

 * We will create an observatory to investigate inclusiveness in public
   management and to evaluate and design institutional actions which will
   address the needs of access to public administrations of a diverse society.
 * We will develop a training plan for participation, which will be aimed at
   both the staff of the Public Administrations and the social agents.
 * We will create citizens bodies to dialogue with technical and political
   staff. These spaces of encounter will be granted decision-making powers and
   will also be complemented by tools for virtual participation." />
