focus on the mapping, funding, mediation and promotion of social sports
projects, physical education and research and dissemination as well as the
promotion of the creation of value in sports through R&amp;D&amp;I.

Schools or sports clubs in depressed areas, in cities as well as in rural areas

Organizations that perform sports activities which have an impact on schools and
are concerned with the environment or social activities of general interest.
