competitiveness because of its negative social and economic effects. To do this,
we will repeal the last two labour reform laws and will adopt measures to
promote sufficient growth of wages and improve purchasing power. Also we will

in the most recent labour reform. We will increase the minimum wage and end wage
cuts in the public sector." />
