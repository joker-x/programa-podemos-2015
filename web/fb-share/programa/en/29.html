	<meta property="og:description" content="We will reform the negotiation model and apply the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) in Spain with the priority aim of improving the distribution of
agricultural income and promoting public and environmental interests. We will
develop and adapt regulations to put in place a farming and fishing sector which
is based upon diversification, sustainability, and a social and family-centered
economy. Furthermore, we will approach extensive farming with the strategic aim
of food sovereignty in mind. We will promote appropriate and innovative
regulations in the fishing sector in order to achieve previously-agreed (though
not yet achieved) social and environmental targets so that we can plan gradual
changes in the different fishing methods and improve the design of criteria and
the distribution of quotas." />
