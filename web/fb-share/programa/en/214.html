	<meta property="og:description" content="We will convene representatives of citizens, holders of intellectual property
rights, cultural industries and technology companies to achieve and promote a
new social pact that brings together creators, intermediaries and citizens,
balance their social interests and set up a more equitable system of
intellectual property which is sustainable and fair. It is necessary to abandon
the current approach, which is fundamentally punitive and has proved to be
ineffective, to build a framework to promote citizen access to culture, enhance
culture as a common good, promote the plurality of models of cultural diffusion
and ensure the sustainability of the sector and, within the framework of
European directives, conforms to our cultural and technological reality.

It will value authors, performers and other holders of intellectual property
rights as creators of works and cultural content, and encourage flexibility in
models of diffusion of culture whilst respecting the autonomy of the creators.

Finally, we will return to the judiciary exclusive authority to decide which
websites and services of the information society violate regulations on
intellectual property and its consequences. We will undo the attribution made by
the so-called Sinde-Wert law to a dependent commission of the current Ministry
of Education, Culture and Sports.

From these principles, a Copyright Act will be promoted:

 * to make new legal and free use of protected works possible in the field of
   education and research, with the extension of the limit of illustration for
   teaching provisions recognized in the regulation.
 * to extend the concept of quotation to fit the real current context.
 * to make new legal and free use of creating derivative works from copyrighted
   works possible when no profit is involved.
 * to extend the concept of private copying, without prejudice to the
   establishment of an appropriate model of compensatory remuneration for
   authors and other rights holders, as required by European directives.
 * to remove the canon on the Association of Spanish Newspaper Publishers (AEDE)
   or &#39;Google tax&#39;.
 * to promote nonprofit making broadcasting and legal and free access to new
   projects funded with public money, for a period of time, with certain formats
   and given sufficient time after first release to allow for its exploitation
   and repayment in line with the activity of the New Platform of Open Culture
   (NPOC).
 * to prioritize free software over trademark software in public administration
   where there are equivalent free tools.
 * To encourage existing or new mandatory rights to entities to guarantee the
   exercise of their inalienable right to promote their works through open or
   free licenses. It is also committed to streamlining the scope of the
   management organization rights and to relax the legal requirements for
   creation. We will focus on introducing mechanisms to ensure responsible
   management, transparency and internal democracy, in addition to control fees
   in order to gradually implement the requirement that their repertoires are
   made public.
 * to recognize journalists stage directors and stage and audiovisual designers,
   among others as authors." />
