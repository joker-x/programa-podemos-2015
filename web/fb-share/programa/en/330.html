	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Recognition of the State of Palestine" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will recognize Palestine as a state imminently and unilaterally. We believe
this first step is essential, but not the only one to ensure peace, respect for
human rights and security (UN human security doctrine) between Israel and
Palestine and the recognition and enjoyment of the national rights.

It will be an historic commitment of our government not only with the
Palestinians but also with the people of our country. That historic commitment
will materialize in concrete actions as a first step to address other issues, so
we propose that the UN Security Council set a binding deadline for negotiations
between Israelis and Palestinians under the supervision and control of
international multilateral organizations.

In the event that human rights violations occur, our country will promote
sanctions against the policies of occupation, segregation, discrimination and
collective punishment by the State of Israel towards the Palestinian people." />
