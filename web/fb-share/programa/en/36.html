	<meta property="og:description" content="In our Science Rescue Plan we present this special challenge which aims to
recover young talent: the Margarita Comas Challenge. Through it, young
researchers will be given contracts so they can establish themselves and open
new laboratories in our country. These will be four-year contracts, at the end
of which researchers will be able to apply to move on to a permanent contract,
which will offer job security and will be subject to a continuous assessment of
objectives.

This special opportunity, together with other wide-ranging initiatives, will
create real job opportunities in research." />
