	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Modifying indirect taxation, particularly IVA (VAT)" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will modify indirect taxation and, in particular, value added tax (IVA), in
order to contribute to an improvement in social welfare. We will pursue a system
of rates that maintain levels of revenue collection as far as possible but which
improve their redistributive impact and limit their regressive nature.

We will increase the number of foods and non-alcoholic drinks which currently
have the super-reduced rate of 4% (except for those where such an increase may
not be advisable for reasons of public health) and we will apply the
super-reduced rate of 10% to all basic services (heating, gas, electricity)
which currently carry the general 20% rate.

We will reduce the rate applicable to products of great social interest such as
cultural or educational products, which means that we will return to the
situation as it was before the reforms carried out by the Partido Popular (PP).

We will apply the new 25% rate to luxury items in order to compensate, as far as
possible, for the fall in revenue caused by the previously-mentioned rate
reductions." />
