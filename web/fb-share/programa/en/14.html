	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Citizen participation and auditing of the implementation of large infrastructures" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will stand by the completion of all large infrastructure works investments
that have already been adjudicated (AVE, highways, airports, port docks) and the
stoppage of all that have not yet been adjudicated.

We will carry out an audit of major infrastructures to clarify the nature of the
decisions made about each construction and their actual costs, in order to
establish responsibilities and prevent such cases as unused airports, empty toll
motorways or projects such as “Proyecto Castor” in Castellón.

Likewise, we will establish transparency and citizen participation procedures in
large infrastructure contracts. These new decision-making methods will include
social, environmental and economic variables so will always be sustainable
within these three parameters." />
