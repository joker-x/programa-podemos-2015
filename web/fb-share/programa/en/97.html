	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote mechanisms of internal flexibility in companies when there are
changes in demand and levels of economical activity, in order to avoid
unemployment as well as salary adjustments.

Likewise, we will promote mechanisms of legal internal flexibility (already
existing but little used) through the reduction of working hours. To avoid a
parallel decline in salaries, we will reinforce a mechanism of adjustment
similar to the German model, by which the loss of working hours is compensated
by the State in payment terms." />
