	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote a reform of the law 29/1994 of 24th November on urban rents in
order to facilitate stable and accessible rents:

 * Rents will be regulated to protect the party that is usually more vulnerable
   in rental contracts: the tenants.
 * Mechanisms will be introduced to assure the rent and its stability by
   lengthening the minimum period of extension of rental of a habitual residence
   to five years.
 * When the tenant belongs to a particularly vulnerable social group and the
   renter is the owner of many properties (that is, the owner of at least ten
   properties) there will be an automatic contract extension.
 * Social rents will be guaranteed for those persons in debt in good faith and
   their family units, who, having given up or lost their only home in a
   mortgage operation, do not have any alternative accommodation. The guarantors
   of this social rent will be the owners of numerous properties, especially
   financial entities and associated estate agencies, vulture funds, asset
   management companies (including those which have arisen from bank
   restructuring and estate agent entities) in whose hands are empty flats, with
   which a public pool of social home rents will be created, once this process
   is regulated by law.
 * Similarly, the concept of social rent will be regulated by law, so that it
   cannot be more than 30% of the family income (including basic utilities).
   Likewise, the limits of the number of members in the family unit will be
   taken into account in order to reduce the amount paid to a sustainable
   threshold.
 * To modify the procedure of rental evictions to guarantee the right of defence
   of the tenants." />
