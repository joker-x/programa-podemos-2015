	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Investing in responsible science and R&amp;D" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will bring public investment levels in R&amp;D back to what they were before the
economic crisis and will endeavour to return R&amp;D investment targets in our
country to the level of those in European countries (2% of GDP).

The objective will be to achieve an investment in R&amp;D of 2.7% of the National
Budget in 2017, and 3% in 2020.

We will ensure that loans from public funds given to R&amp;D companies are used for
what they were initially intended, and not as hidden subsidies. To this end, we
will monitor and guarantee that funds intended to be invested in R&amp;D are
employed 100% in accordance with what was approved in the National Budget." />
