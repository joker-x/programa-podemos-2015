	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: New Law on Political Party Financing" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop a specific plan for crime prevention in the context of political
parties with the following proposals for the control of funding:

 * To equate the control of the political foundations with that of political
   parties.
 * To prohibit donations of real estate whose value exceeds the legal limit for
   monetary donations.
 * To prohibit bank debt by political parties or severely limit such borrowing.
 * To publish the identity of donors who contribute over 5,000 Euros a year.
 * To establish systems for the processing and publication of data in reusable
   formats, in order to identify possible links between political donations and
   public contracts, or between political parties and tax havens.
 * To develop a strategic plan regarding political parties funding in Spain, and
   reform electoral systems and ordinary party financing under more democratic
   and inclusive principles.

With regard to criminal treatment, our proposals are:

 * To increase the limitation period of sanctions provided for in Statutory Law
   on political party funding and clarify cases of sanction duplication.
 * To specifically develop and adapt to political groups, the rule expressed in
   article 31 bis of the Penal Code aimed at regulating general criminal
   liability." />
