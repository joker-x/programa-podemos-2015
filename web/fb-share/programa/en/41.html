	<meta property="og:description" content="We will release PRIs from political control and promote the development of
self-governance in their research long-term projections

We will propose a deep process of democratisation for the PRIs, so they can
develop autonomy in their own administration and research.

We will reform their statutes and implement strategic multi-year plans
specifically designed for each institution. The transition towards
democratisation must be accompanied by a corresponding assumption of
responsibilities and account rendering." />
