	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Election recall for lack of fulfillment of electoral programme" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="Electoral programmes must be understood as contracts with the general public.
Therefore, PODEMOS has set out some minimum contractual commitments and, in case
of default, will propose an election recall. Therefore, after two years in
office, a non-permanent commission within the Congress of Deputies will be
launched in which the degree of compliance with the electoral programme will be
discussed. The activity of this commission will be held for up to six months,
and the results of their work will be submitted to the House for votation.

If a substantial and evident breach of the electoral programme has occurred, a
repeal process can be started. To do this, the initiative must have the support
of 158 members of parliament and duly audited signatures of 15% of the state
electorate.

If both requirements are met, a referendum will be held in which citizens will
be asked whether new elections should be held for breach of programme. If the
referendum result is affirmative, the Prime Minister will convene elections
within a maximum period of thirty days." />
