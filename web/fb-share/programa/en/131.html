	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Guaranteed access to basic utilities" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will guarantee access to basic utilities as part of the right to decent,
adequate housing. In order to guarantee this we propose the following:

 * that the right to utility contracts only requires registration as a resident
   with the town hall.
 * We will prevent cuts to basic utilities: water, electricity and gas to family
   units in vulnerable circumstances. The payment of basic utilities for
   families in these situations will be made according to the earning power of
   the family unit, whilst respecting the standards of the United Nations
   Organization (UN).
 * The costs associated with guaranteeing this right and any accumulated debt
   which cannot be met by the vulnerable parties will be met by the utility
   company which should meet the requirements of corporative social
   responsibility laid down by the law.

Furthermore, we will explore the possibility of creating a public utility
company." />
