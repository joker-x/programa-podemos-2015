	<meta property="og:description" content="From the conviction that foreign policy follows basic general principles, but at
the same time should reflect the diversity of the state, and also from the
conviction that there must be transparent and open political participation of
civil society with mechanisms of control and accountability, we will create a
Policy and Foreign Activities Interregional Council to involve civil society and
strengthen inter-ministerial coordination. Similarly, we will create a citizen’s
council to participate in the development and monitoring of our foreign policy
and the respect and protection of human rights.

In line with this, we will reform and will adapt the Instituto Cervantes to the
linguistic and cultural diversity of Spain, and we will transform the Marca
España, from a conciliatory perspective, so it will represent the diversity and
the plurality of our country and the interests of all the citizenship." />
