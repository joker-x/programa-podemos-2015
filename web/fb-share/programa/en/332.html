	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Scientific and cultural cooperation with the United States to avoid a human capital flight" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="In order to reverse brain drain of Spanish scientist to the United States, we
will strengthen scientific, cultural and educational cooperation with this
country. To do this, we will increase the budget for grants for further studies
and professional internships and scientific research related to projects by
Spaniards, and we will promote incentives to encourage the return of Spanish
researchers having expanded their training in the United States.

In addition, we will develop a United Plan, an initiative to establish greater
cultural, educational and economic ties with the Hispanic community in the US,
almost a third of the population of that country. The network of Instituto
Cervantes centres will help to reinforce its Latin American connection to
organize and promote cultural activities that involve the richness of Spanish
language and culture in Spain and America.

We will also create a network of business incubators and accelerators in the
United States and Spain to contribute to the creation of viable and innovative
business projects in both countries, especially in the field of social and
solidarity economy, to facilitate the entry of Spanish SMEs in the US market and
the subsequent profit." />
