 * Reviewing their statutes, so as to eliminate loopholes or duplication of

 * Ensuring the independence of the public sector from the apparatus and
   interests of political parties.
 * Regaining those competencies and prerogatives that have been privatized or
   outsourced.
 * Reviewing assignments to instrumental entities so as to reverse those
   services that have been subcontracted, providing adequate budgeting and
   resources to better structure the public sector." />
