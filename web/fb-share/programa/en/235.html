	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Reducing the number of senior posts" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will drastically reduce the number of political senior posts in both public
agencies and companies, so that these senior positions are only held by those
working as ministers or similar and deputy ministers or equivalents. We will
recover labour rights directly related to reconciling family and professional
life, including the system of paid leave, paid holidays and pension rights.

The administrative units with the rank of general directorship or general
secretariat should be led by technically qualified teams, establishing a listing
of managerial functions. Appropriate people must be selected to fill jobs of
greater responsibility and this requires a recruitment system which ensures
independent access on the basis of equality, merit and ability.To prevent
lobbying firms from hiring former members of parliament or their assistants. In
the case of lobby companies employing former members of the Government, the
obligation for these lobbyists to report who their customers are, what political
representatives they contact, what topics are dealt with and what expenses are
incurred during their work." />
