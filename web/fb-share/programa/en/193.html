	<meta property="og:description" content="We will implement specific protection measures for single-parent families, in
order to compensate for their particularly vulnerable situation.

 * We will provide a precise definition of single-parent family so that their
   status as such is recognized under the same criteria throughout all public
   administration levels. To help in this respect, a single-parent accreditation
   card will be provided.
 * We will introduce a non-contributive maternity benefit for parents who are
   out of work, without resources and actively seeking employment.
 * We will include the specific category of &#34;single-parent family&#34; in order to
   facilitate their access to allowances for school meals and learning
   materials.
 * We will specifically recognize single-parent families their right to rent
   allowances, with priority access to public sector housing.
 * We will give 0 to 3 year old children from single-parent families priority
   when it comes to accessing infant education places." />
