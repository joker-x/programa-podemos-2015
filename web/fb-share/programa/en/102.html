	<meta property="og:description" content="We will establish an extra benefit for those workers with low salaries in order
to eliminate discrimination caused by the “poverty trap” and to assure that
these workers reach sufficient levels of welfare. When people with this
guaranteed benefit find a job or are able to work, this pension will be
withdrawn gradually (not suddenly) in accordance with salary increases. The
result will be to guarantee a minimum income for these workers of 900 Euros per
month, which will be increased according to the number of members in the family.
This complement will only be effective for those with a recognized salary of at
least 250 Euros, in order to avoid possible fraud." />
