	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Plan for the Social Use of Land" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will establish a Public and Autonomous Agency for Sustainable and Responsible
Management of the Land, to regulate farmlands and favour democratic and just
access to the land.

We will develop a Special Plan for the Social Use of the Land, as a reply to the
inventory of land ownership developed by the Ministry of Finance and also to the
plan for the transfer of title of these properties carried out by the
Government.

We will promote coordination between the Agency for Sustainable and Responsible
Management of Land and the preexisting Land Banks so as to facilitate priority
access to young people and women who wish to work in the agricultural, livestock
and forestry industries, putting measures in place to ensure that these owners
can use and manage their lands." />
