	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Restoration of the legality of border checkpoints: respect for human rights on the southern border" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will put an immediate end to the illegal expulsion of people in the border
areas, which violates international laws. To do this, we will repeal the
relevant articles of the Statutory Law 4/2015, 30th March, for the protection of
citizen security.

Also, we will end the human rights violations that occur on the southern border.
To do this, we will remove the harmful elements placed at border perimeter of
Ceuta and Melilla and promote the adoption of a protocol of the State Security
Forces on this southern border. In addition, we will review the bilateral treaty
with Morocco, to ensure strict compliance with the principle of no enforced
return." />
