	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop the ability of decision-making, and the resources to exercise
it, to all united or pooled municipalities. We will consciously work to
guarantee the defence of specific organization models for municipalities and
smaller entities which form the territorial unit. We will protect their heritage
rights over the territory and we will put in place a definitive Law for the
Sustainable Development of Rural Areas, so that positive discrimination will be
ensured for those districts with greater depopulation and lack of
infrastructure. We will attempt to give sufficient resources to district
authorities (united or pooled municipalities) to self-manage the basic services
in their territory and also participate in controlling the actions performed by
regional and State administrations within it." />
