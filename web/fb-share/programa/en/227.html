	<meta property="og:description" content="Parliamentary regulations of the general chambers of State will become a tool
for transparency, public participation and accountability of these institutions.
The regulatory reform affects three fundamental aspects:

 * Increased strength of citizenship: involvement of civil society in the
   legislative process. We will create mixed spaces for discussion during the
   legislative process including political representatives, technical personnel
   and members of the general public. We will include a citizen parliamentary
   seat.
 * All parliamentary activities shall be governed by the principles of
   transparency and political control. We will develop accessible web tools that
   make the activity in the chamber transparent.
 * Capacity for action and equal basic rights for all parliamentary groups in
   the organization of the chambers. Political plurality is the true reflection
   of the diversity and plurality of society." />
