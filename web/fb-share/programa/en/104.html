	<meta property="og:description" content="We will repeal the funding cutbacks in health, education and care of the
elderly, so that, during the first two years of the term of office, the levels
prior to the crisis will be recovered. From that moment on, we will increase
expenditure per inhabitant, in order to work towards a closing of the gap
between real expenditure of 10% per inhabitant and the EU average of 15%. The
aim is to strengthen and to extend our welfare state." />
