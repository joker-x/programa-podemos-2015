	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: General Directorship of Digital Culture and Public Platform of Open Culture" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will incorporate the new General Directorship of Digital Culture into the
organizational structure of the Ministry of Culture and Communication. This will
act across the board with other General Directorships and will aim to develop
public cultural policies suited to the digital environment. From this new
directorship, among other projects, we will launch the Public Platform of Open
Culture (PLACA) in order to make quota-free contents available to everyone,
promoting the distribution of digital creations in general, controlling public
cultural funds and increasing the diffusion of artistic creation and cultural
heritage in the digital environment. Among other actions, through PLACA the
following activities will be carried out:

 * To promote the use and knowledge of quota-free contents and digital tools.
 * To make available for the public free of charge (by streaming) music,
   literary and audiovisual creations of any kind from those independent
   creators and producers who request it.
 * To digitalize art collections of public museums to make them available to the
   public, as well as developing augmented reality content for the museum
   heritage sites in educational and research purposes.
 * to promote dissemination in the digital field, the development of new digital
   content and digitization of the contents of public centres of documentation
   and dissemination such as the Spanish Film Library (Filmoteca Española),
   Theatre and Musical Documentation Centre, and the National Library. On the
   other hand, the General Directorship of Digital Culture will also promote the
   digitalization process of editorial collections through the purchase of
   digital titles for libraries, and will cooperate in the management of
   electronic book lending with local, regional and state public libraries." />
