	<meta property="og:description" content="Within the framework of a set of measures for a reform of taxation on culture
focusing on the strengthening and stimulation of creation, production,
distribution and access, we will lower the reduced rate of Value Added Tax (IVA)
on cultural services and products, currently under the standard rate. This
reform will imply a modification of Law 37 / 1992 on VAT and will have as its
goal standardization with European community regulations and jurisprudence.
However, we will attempt, along with other European countries, to modify the
strict distinction between product and service, in order to determine
corresponding tax rates." />
