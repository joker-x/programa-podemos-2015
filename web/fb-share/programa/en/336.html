	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Increase on budget for Official Development Assistance" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will allocate 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) to Official Development
Assistance (ODA) in a maximum of two terms (we will set as a goal for the first
term of a minimum of 0.4%). ODA will act outside of commercial, geostrategic or
any other nature interests that differ from those contained in the Agreement for
Global Justice, and will take their performance based on the principles of
sufficiency, predictability and technical support.

Public-private partnerships will be subordinated to a new strategy for private
sector participation in sustainable development that will be built with
organized citizens and will be mandatory for companies participating in these
alliances and actions of international cooperation and solidarity.

In addition, we will conduct audits with citizen participation (including the
partner countries of the international solidarity and cooperation) on the impact
on equality, human rights, gender equity and environmental sustainability of the
activities of the companies financed by Spanish ODA funds.

Finally, we will allocate 15% of ODA funds to specific interventions in gender,
women&#39;s empowerment and sexual and reproductive health, prioritizing resource
allocation to feminist movements for women’s rights, in local, national,
regional and international spheres." />
