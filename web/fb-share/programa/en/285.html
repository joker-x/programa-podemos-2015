	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Sustainable cities" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will implement an active policy of transforming urban ecosystems into more
sustainable and inhabitable places for people.

We will abandon the speculative production model based on the immoderate
production of homes and we will commit to a sustainable model oriented to the
rehabilitation and the energy efficiency of the preexistent buildings. This
measure will, at the same time, create higher quality jobs.

We will promote the use of those instruments that urban development legislation
provides public entities with so as to satisfy the demand for affordable
housing, facilities, and open spaces, and we will prevent speculation so as to
increase ownership of public areas.

The city belongs to everyone. That is why we will promote universal access and
the elimination of architectural and urban barriers. At the same time, we will
include a gender perspective and also protect children and the elderly
population when it comes to urban design.

We will take advantage of the opportunities that new technology brings to us to
manage urban ecosystems efficiently and we will commit towards the development
of intelligent towns and cities.

We will ensure the transparency of procedures for the preparation of urban plans
and agreements, aiming to encourage and facilitate access to all information
regarding these matters, including technical and legal reports.

We will avoid the urbanization of areas of high environmental value, especially
on the coastline, and also areas of natural risk such as floodable lands." />
