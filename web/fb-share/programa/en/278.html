   block voting. We will also reduce the number of representatives.
 * The functions of the Senate will be: * Legislative function: taking part in
      the passing of laws that affect territorial interests.
    * Participation in the National Budget
      in order to determine those budget items that are attributed to different
      territories according to the system of financing
    * Appointment of the members of bodies
      of State and national institutions, such as Constitutional Court
      magistrates.
    * As a key piece in both vertical and
      horizontal relations of territorial distribution of power, it will carry
      out an important role in relation to the Presidents’ Conference." />
