	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Reform of National Agency for the Evaluation of Quality and Certification (ANECA)." />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will reform the system of evaluation to guarantee the objectives of teaching,
research and diffusion of knowledge as well as the principles of equality and
quality of teaching and university autonomy.

We will bring evaluations into line with the reality of universities by means of
mechanisms for the participation of the university community via democratically
elected representatives.

We will include complementary external evaluations with international parameters
along with those which have existed until now, which will be adapted to the
internal logic of each discipline and area of knowledge.

The ANECA (the National Agency for Evaluation and Certification) will create a
seal entitled “Woman and Science” to reward those centres with a proven
track-record in equal opportunities. Amongst the criteria to obtain this
distinction, the presence of women in the make-up of scientific and academic
committees will be valued as well as the implementation of action protocols
against harassment or the contracting of personnel based on criteria of equality
in the politics of conciliation." />
