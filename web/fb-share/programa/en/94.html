	<meta property="og:description" content="We will reform temporary and part-time recruitment with the following
objectives:

 * Work and particular service contracts must be automatically transformed into
   permanent contracts either when their duration is over one year or when there
   is a chain of contracts for this period.
 * Seasonal part-time contracts must become permanent non-continuous contracts
   which preserve the right of re-employment.
 * Part-time contracts must incorporate the principle of causality in reference
   to the time necessary to carry out the tasks included in the contract.
   Furthermore, these contracts must establish the weekly calculation of the
   working day and must establish a minimum of 50 % of a normal work day.

Currently, 76% of people with part-time jobs are women, and 60.8 % of these
women do so involuntarily. We must end with this working model and guarantee the
creation of stable, quality employment." />
