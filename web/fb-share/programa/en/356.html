	<meta property="og:description" content="We will guarantee proper budget allocation, with complements from the Central
Administration whenever Canarias Government cannot fund the sector assigned to
it, with the aim of fulfilling the main goals of POSEI, which are the following:

 * Promotion of sustainable development that allows the continuation of
   agriculture and livestock activities in Canarias and the increase of
   self-sufficiency, taking steps towards food sovereignty, as well as the
   maintenance of decent agrarian incomes, that uphold the agricultural
   landscape, customs and traditions, to avoid the desertification of soil and
   preserve biodiversity, all of which will bring an improvement in product
   quality and the incorporation of differentiating elements in the market.
 * Equal funding for all who produce in the same conditions.
 * Guarantee of the supply of products for consumption and transformation and
   also of agrarian consumables that compensate for the excessive costs incurred
   on account of being RUP territory.
 * Prohibition of compensations to products competing against local production.
 * Establishment of enough control and inspection mechanisms to stop fraud.
 * Creation of a simplified access system to subsidies for small farmers.
 * Promotion of agro ecological operations.
 * Prohibition of subsidies to transgenic product imports.
 * Promotion of a change in the energy model towards a new model of renewable
   clean, efficient and sustainable energies." />
