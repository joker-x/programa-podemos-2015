	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Elimination of the nationality test and reductions in the time to obtain citizenship" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="* We will remove the Spanish nationality test, currently a mandatory
   requirement to obtain Spanish nationality.
 * We will shorten the time required to acquire the nationality by residence:
   five years general term, three years for refugees, and one year for the
   original population of specific countries with a good historical relationship
   with Spain.
 * We will remove bureaucratic obstacles and random requirements in the
   procedure. We will remove the general requirement of renunciation of origin
   nationality to countries without multiple nationality treaties, at least in
   certain cases (for example, the refugee population).
 * We will give greater importance to the principle of jus soli (right of the
   soil) in the attribution of the national origin." />
