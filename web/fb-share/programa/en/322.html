	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Opposition to the TTIP" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Treaty (TTIP) is a threat to our
sovereignty, our democracy, our economy and the welfare state because it
conceives of the social and environmental regulations as barriers to trade.

In consequence:

 * We oppose the ratification of trade agreements TTIP, GATS (General Agreement
   on Trade in Services) and CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement)
   and we will establish a dialogue with other European governments to act in
   the same way.
 * We will audit and will end all International Investment Agreements (IIA)
   containing secret mechanisms of Investor-state dispute settlements.
 * We will promote the creation of an international network of governments and
   multilateral institutions like the United Nations Conference on Trade and
   Development (UNCTAD) and International Labour Organization (ILO), a change in
   trade and investment policies of the European Council and a dissuasive
   approach to ensure that European Union countries do not pressure others to
   sign new commerce and investment treaties.
 * We will elaborate a comprehensive impact study, involving civil society, the
   common commercial policy of the European Union in Spain and in the world." />
