	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote measures to improve the quality of life in the olive industry
and its conditions of commercialization and export:

 * We will support the industry related to agrarian business in Jaen.
 * We will support mediation in the price of olive oil to end abusive practices.
 * We will promote the distribution and bottling of olive oil from the province
   to invest in less dependence on intermediaries.
 * We will ensure strict compliance with the rules of getting and use of
   designations of origin and protected geographical indications.
 * We will promote the implementation of complementary crops on farms dedicated
   to olive.
 * Through publicity campaigns we will explain the special characteristics of
   olive oil as the basis of the Mediterranean diet, to value its qualities.
 * We will support the declaration of the Andalucía olive groves as World
   Patrimony by Unesco." />
