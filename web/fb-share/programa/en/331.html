	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop a new plan for Africa with the aim of supporting African
societies in their efforts to promote democracy, human rights, gender equality
and sustainable and inclusive development. This plan will be done in a framework
of policy coherence, and will involve both Spanish civil society actors and
African plaintiffs.

We will defend the strengthening of mechanisms to fight tax evasion and
transparent control in natural resource management. In this sense, we will
advocate a responsible Spanish business presence which is transparent and
respectful with those principles.

Furthermore we will prioritize cooperation with African regional and
sub-regional organizations in multilateral forums." />
