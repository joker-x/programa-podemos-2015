	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Fair and responsible fishing quotas" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop urgent measures to open a real and balanced dialogue between all
actors involved in the fisheries sector in order to improve the standards of
transparency in the allocation and management of fishing quotas.

We will promote responsibility and sustainability in production and social
equity criteria with those who make a living from the sea, and advocate a linear
non-transferable distribution of catches according to boat / crew ratios
according to the new framework for allocating quotas. We will make the payment
of fines and penalties flexible according to the business situation. Penalties
for violations will basically be the prohibition to going out to fish for a
certain period depending on the severity of the offence, in order to increase
the effectiveness of fines and eliminate the current tax collection with its
suspected money-making intention." />
