   Madrid 2009-2015.
 * Perform a study report and a budget for the expansion of the C4 commuter
   train line.
 * Define and analyze viable route alternatives to build the railway
   infrastructure.
 * Analyze the viability and, where applicable, the most suitable site for the
   construction of two new stations: a first next to the Hospital de Parla, and
   the second in the proximity of the towns of Torrejón de la Calzada and
   Torrejón de Velasco. This analysis will take into account accessibility,
   demand, connections with other public transport and ease of construction.
 * A specific study of the conditions of operation and transport demand.
 * Expanion of C4 commuter rail line, provided its technical and economic
   viability is demonstrated." />
