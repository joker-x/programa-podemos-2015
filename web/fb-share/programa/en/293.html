	<meta property="og:description" content="We will cancel the Concordat of 1953 and the five concordat agreements signed by
the Spanish State with the Holy See in 1976 and 1979, as well as the ones signed
with other religious creeds. We will also promote or carry out other measures
such as:

 * Commitment to a high quality, public and secular education. Removal of the
   subject of Religion from the syllabus, school schedules and educational
   centres.
 * Removal of chaplaincies and religious services from public institutions
   (hospitals, universities, prisons, embassies etc.). -Inventory and recovery
   of goods taken by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church (RCAC) under now
   obsolete article 206 of Mortgage Law and article 304 from its regulation, in
   which bishops were given the status of certifying officers.
 * Abolition of articles from the Criminal Code that consider as a crime offence
   to religious feelings.
 * Elimination of the tax privileges, such as the non-payment of the Property
   Council Tax or the state funding (through marking the box on Personal Income
   Tax returns or through the tax exemptions) for the Catholic Church or other
   religious creeds.
 * Abolition of the celebrations and religious symbols in official ceremonies,
   honours or tributes to religious images or dedications, as well as the public
   presence of authorities in confessional ceremonies." />
