	<meta property="og:description" content="We will widen the availability of professional training within the network of
public centres with planning that responds to the demands of the work market and
the territorial environment, especially in rural areas, with a sufficient supply
of human and material resources, in order to improve educational standards and
the qualifications of the population. Thus we will avoid a large number of young
people finding themselves without a place in public teaching centres, something
which occurs at present.

Aspects of teaching and work will be regulated in training agreements with the
work place, so that companies assume their social responsibilities and students
obtain sufficient financial reward, which will be of benefit to both parties.

to obtain the corresponding competence without this being in detriment to the

extended Professional Training will be suspended until a few designs are in
place, since the current system does not fulfil the minimum requirements of
quality in neither its training nor work experience aspects." />
