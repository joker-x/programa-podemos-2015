	<meta property="og:description" content="As well as Castilian Spanish, the official language throughout the Spanish
territory, there are other languages of varying official status according to
their respective regional statutes. All of these languages, including Castilian
Spanish, represent the cultural and linguistic heritage of the whole state.

Given that citizens have the right to an education delivered in these languages,
their linguistic normalization is necessary via a respect for cultural and
pedagogic decisions which different autonomic regions have adopted and for the
European Chart of Minority and Regional Languages. For this reasons, we
guarantee access to education in co-official languages in any region via
specific centres and the promotion of school exchanges between different
autonomous regions. Also, cultural identity will be encouraged via the awareness
of the cultural environment and inter-cultural values with a curriculum adapted
to the language and culture of each territory within the Spanish State." />
