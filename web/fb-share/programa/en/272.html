of Defence and the military industry, so as to make them completely transparent.
Acquisitions from contractors will be audited, reviewed and renegotiated in
order to stay within budget.

Also, in consonance with this, a group of experts (along with which civil
society will be able to participate) will be established for the purpose of
coming up with proposals to study a new design for the Army, that should be more
appropriate to Spain’s needs." />
