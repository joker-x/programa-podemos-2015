	<meta property="og:description" content="We will adjust current regulations to a new framework to encourage new
sustainable production activities which contribute to the creation of employment
in rural areas. We will modify mountain legislation to include a set of rules
for protection which forbids re-categorizing and construction on burnt land and
which considers forest resources as essential components of the nature heritage
of our country and the fight against the climate change.

We will increase the participation of citizens and forest agents in the
development of Ordination Plans of the Forest Resources.

We will encourage local development by public administration of forest resources
and we will eliminate the subcontracting of the forest labour in order to
encourage the use of local companies." />
