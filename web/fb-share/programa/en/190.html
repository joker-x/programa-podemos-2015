	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Comprehensive Law against Human Trafficking" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will reinforce the central role of victims as subjects with rights, and we
will act in a coordinated way to assure the protection, identification and
detection of the people who are victims of human trafficking.

We will reinforce protection, with guaranteed periods of establishment and
reflection. We will also forbid repatriation or confinement in a Confinement
Centre for Immigrants (CIE). We will eliminate criminal responsibility of
victims who are in irregular situation as a result of non-cooperation with the
authorities

We will train professionals in the legal field, responsible for the processing
of visas and asylum; members of the State Security Forces and employment
inspectors who will have a psycho-social perspective.

We will create mechanisms for comprehensive attention to victims. These
mechanisms will represent a conciliatory, trans-cultural approach to an
effective protection in the case of reports and beyond the legal process. We
will guarantee the right to asylum in the various cases of human trafficking, as
well as the automatic grant of temporary residency visas." />
