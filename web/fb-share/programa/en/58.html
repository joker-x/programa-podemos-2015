	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Constitution of a strong and effective public banks from the nationalized entities Bankia and Banco Mare Nostrum" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will build strong and effective public banks from the nationalized entities
Bankia and Banco Mare Nostrum, for which we will renegotiate the terms of the
memorandum of understanding signed with the EU. The performance criteria of
public banks should be different from private banks. Although profitability is
one of these (so that they can operate sustainably), it will not be the only
one, and public banks will be more orientated towards financing:

 * Infrastructure and public facilities
 * Long-term business projects within a coherent industrial policy that is
   committed to overcoming the current technological and capitalization economic
   needs.
 * Social groups with problems of access to credit, particularly in relation to
   housing and SMEs.

Therefore, public banks have two main areas of intervention: the first, based on
investment banking and development, similar to the model of German Kreditanstalt
für Wiederaufbau, to mobilize the necessary resources for productive and
economic change. The second is based on the development of a public savings bank
for depositors to have a safe banking system focused on the protection of
deposits and attention to the financing needs of retail consumers." />
