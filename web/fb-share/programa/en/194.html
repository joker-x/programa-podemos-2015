	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Special support fund for young mothers and fathers" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will pay particular attention to young parents in order to guarantee that
they can care for their children at the same time as maintaining their
professional careers or the beginning or continuation of their studies.

 * We will introduce incentives for employers to recruit young parents.
 * We will encourage flexible hours, both in places of work and at educational
   institutions, and give priority to young parents when it comes to choosing
   working hours.
 * We will provide young single mothers with financial support through grants.
 * We will set up nursery schools, under the public education service, at
   universities and vocational education centres for parents who may wish to
   enter higher or further education as well as for the staff working in these
   institutions. This will provide effective use of the space and personnel
   available.
 * We will prioritize young mothers and fathers in respect of access to public
   sector rented accommodation." />
