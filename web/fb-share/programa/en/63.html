	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Restructuring mortgage debt of households" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will carry out the restructuring of the mortgage debt of households by
reducing the nominal value of the first home mortgages in the case of families
that meet certain social criteria, such as all its members being unemployed and
without other income or who have incomes below three times the Public Multiple
Effect Income indicator (IPREM).

We will promote this restructuring as a real second chance system for people or
entities which will free them of past debts once the bankruptcy becomes
effective. To achieve this, we will implant a simplified process of
restructuring and cancellation of debt, a simple and accessible procedure, which
will consist of two parts:

 * Conciliation phase before a committee of indebtedness (similar to labour
   conciliation services) to submit proposal to creditors.
 * Judicial phase, in which the judge will agree a payment plan to limit the
   mortgage debt on the mortgaged property, with the option of debt relief or
   debt cancellation on return of property. For the option of debt relief, the
   payment is adjusted according to the value of the mortgaged property. In the
   case of debt cancellation on return of property, this consists of delivering
   the property to the creditor and canceling the full mortgage payment.

Debts arising from previous execution procedures will be cancelled. Debts that
may be incurred in this process will be both private and public loans (with
Social Security and Public Treasury); and this procedure is also valid for the
self-employed and small businesses.

We will legislate for this voluntary delivery of keys as a retroactive law. The
existing mortgage debts of those who have lost their homes due to the
impossibility of continuing loan payment will be cancelled." />
