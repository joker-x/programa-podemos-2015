	<meta property="og:description" content="We will recover the effective tariff in wealth tax, and inheritance and gift
tax. The second of this tax, the inheritance and gift tax, will fall on high
income groups. Working in coordination with the regions, we will revoke the
inheritance and gift tax reimbursements, which have gradually, in practice,
resulted in being applied only to high income groups. We will review the value
of heirs&#39; previous assets, which is used to fix the tax tariff, so that we can
ensure that poverty considerations do not play a part in unwanted refusals to
accept an inheritance.

We will put an end to SICAV companies in their present form: we will regulate
their fiscal regime in order to stop big fortunes using them as smoke-screen
companies for tax avoidance purposes. To this end we will ensure that the number
of partners is real and effective, and will fix a maximum period of permanence
for accumulated capital gains and a maximum percentage of shares that can be
held by each investor. We will also set a maximum capital investment for each
shareholder. Furthermore, we will give the AEAT the power to ensure compliance
with these requirements and, to this end we will put a special plan in place to
regulate the fraudulent situations which are currently found in the sector.
Whenever the AEAT verifies that such requirements are not being adhered to and
that, consequently, a specific SICAV is neither a real nor effective collective
investment company, it will impose the general company tax rate." />
