	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Strategic Plan for Adapted Sport" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will secure the Strategic Plan for Adapted Sport on three fundamental
pillars:

To create a specific area of adapted sport within the Sports Council to deal
with the promotion, talent scouting, technical equipment and high performance in
Adapted Sport.

The encouragement of adapted sports promoting activities amongst athletes of
school age.

The coordination of the Spanish Paralympics Committee and national centres
dependent on the Ministry of Health for the recruitment of disabled athletes.

The stimulus of proper technical training plans in the area of disability for
sports officers and employees.

The evaluation of training facilities used by Paralympics athletes to encourage
their renewal and enlargement.

The encouragement of studies and research in areas such as the functional
classification of athletes, new material for sports prosthetics, wheelchairs,
bicycles, adapted vehicles, etc.

To equate grants given to Olympic and Paralympics athletes on behalf of the
Spanish Paralympics Committee and Spanish Federations.

To generate an administrative structure for adapted sports approached from four
areas: sports and competitions, recreation, therapy and education. In order to
accomplish that, we will create different coordinating groups between the
Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality and the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Sport, with the aim of joining public and private institutions,
sports clubs, foundations, local federations and companies." />
