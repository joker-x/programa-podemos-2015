	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Regulation for the education on Spanish language and culture in foreign countries" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will create a regulation for the education of Spanish language and culture in
foreign countries to enhance social and cultural bonding with the descendents of
Spanish emigrants. The regulation will follow this course of action:

 * Making a study on child emigration to acknowledge their social and
   demographical reality.
 * Developing a study broken down by continents into International Sections,
   Spanish Language and Culture classes or existent Spanish or mixed ownership
   facilities that allow the maintenance, reinforcement and opening of new
   classrooms if there are more than twelve applicants.
 * To guarantee face-to-face education at least three hours a week that includes
   comprehensive education on Spanish language and culture.
 * Development of distance training systems where a classroom cannot be opened
   for geographic, demographic or political reasons, thus preventing adequate
   attention to students or where the teachers cannot be guaranteed decent
   working conditions." />
