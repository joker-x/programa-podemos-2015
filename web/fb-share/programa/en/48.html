	<title>PODEMOS: A simpler and more transparent corporation tax</title>
	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: A simpler and more transparent corporation tax" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="* We will reform corporation tax in depth and will promote international
   coordination in order to make it simple, transparent and with effective rates
   that are closer in reality to nominal rates. Besides, we will guarantee that,
   unlike in the present situation, differences are maintained in function of
   the size of the company and how long it has been in operation.
 * We will support and promote the Directiva Accis project, to establish the
   consolidated base to be applied to multinational groups, and its distribution
   among the countries that operate them, in proportion to their sales, capital
   and payroll. The objective will be to limit the loss of revenue associated
   with transfer pricing.
 * We will eliminate fiscal privileges and most deductions. To this end, we will
   control key aspects, such as transfer prices, or financial expense
   deductions. Any tax benefits that may be maintained will need to be duly
   justified, paying particular attention to their effect on productivity and
   job creation.
 * We will introduce a minimum tax for any large corporation that helps with the
   effective tax collection and its stability long-term.
 * We will establish a differentiated rate depending on where profits are
   directed: a standard rate of 30% where profits are distributed to
   shareholders, and a lower rate of 25% when profits are re-invested in the
   company, particularly when they are for capital increase operations, the
   upgrade of equipment or for R&amp;D activities. Any profit re-investment must be
   verified by management and workers’ representatives.
 * We will eliminate the possibility of using companies as smoke-screen
   organisations for tax avoidance purposes, for reducing the amount paid in
   taxes on profits made abroad, or as a vehicle to channel profits made from
   private income." />
