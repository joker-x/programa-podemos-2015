	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote a statutory law for the protection of the rights and
inviolability of the home, and the prohibition of forced evictions without
alternative accommodation. In no circumstances can an eviction take place
against people in vulnerable situations either in the case of lack of payment of
rent or of precarious living circumstances due to lack of housing, without local
authorities guaranteeing adequate alternative accommodation.

We will work towards the setting up of guaranteed judicial processes for cases
in which a restriction of rights to the inviolability of the home has occurred.
We will promote the legalization of the use of empty and abandoned housing." />
