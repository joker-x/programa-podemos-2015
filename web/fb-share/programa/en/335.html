	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Approval of a Pact for Global Justice and a Law on Solidarity and International Cooperation" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote the development, adoption and implementation of a Pact for
Global Justice to articulate a new policy of international solidarity and
cooperation. This pact will consider the adoption of a new Law on Solidarity and
International Cooperation, in a coherent policy framework for sustainable
development. It will constitute the legal support for the state new policy in
this matter. The law will incorporate mechanisms for participation of organized
citizens (social movements, solidarity committees and NGOs on development
issues) in the new politics of solidarity and international cooperation,
especially the Cooperation Council, to turn it into a genuine area of
​​planning, monitoring and evaluation of this policy.

In addition, the Law on Solidarity and International Cooperation will establish
a new financing policy to ensure the active and enthusiastic participation of
citizens in our policy of solidarity and cooperation, adapting its funding to
the functions developed by organizations and social movements in this area in
order to enhance its mobilizing role." />
