	<meta property="og:description" content="We will abolish Law 2/2013, 29th May, for the protection and sustainable use of
coastal areas. We will also modify Law 22/1988, 28th July, of coastal areas.
This will be done in order to introduce real and effective protection measures
of undeveloped coastline. We will also promote its application and development,
to maintain State jurisdiction to abolish actions and agreements among local
agencies that affect the maritime- terrestrial public domain. With all these
measures we intend to stop the destruction (due to building speculation) of
undeveloped coastal areas of Murcia. Moreover, we will avoid situations in which
projects of great negative environmental impact were supported by laws such as
the Murcia Region Land Law which meant the suppression of protection of a large
part of the coastal area affected by the construction of the housing complex
Marina de Cope." />
