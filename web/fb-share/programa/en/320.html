taxes where they generate profits. The agency will aim:

 * To study the creation of a global wealth tax to gradually tax large blocks of
   wealth as a guarantee of social rights.
 * The adoption of a tax on financial transactions.
 * Fixing a universal definition and binding rules for tax havens." />
