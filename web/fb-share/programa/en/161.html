	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: The sports recipe: more sports centres and fewer out-patients clinics" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We consider that an Integral Plan for the Promotion of Health is essential to
address sedentary behaviour and child obesity, especially if we want our society
to advance in a healthy way. We will do this from a family and community
perspective, assuring that this plan coordinates the different departments
involved, the autonomous communities and town councils.

We have three main goals:

To reduce current sedentary and child obesity statistics (43 %) and the burden
of sedentary-related illnesses (between 20% and 30%; cardiovascular diseases,
type II diabetes, breast and colon cancer).

Prevent unhealthy habits such as smoking and alcohol consumption.

Influence the current mortality rate (between 8% or 14%), which is currently
attributed to these causes.

We will have a multidisciplinary approach, creating active communities in which
health, cultural, entertainment, spots, educational, employment and social
communities are all involved.

Referrals to sports centres and out of school activities will be made by various
agents, especially paediatricians or paediatric nurses, and from the area of
social services, associations promoting infant health and, of course, the
education system. Involvement of parents in these activities will be necessary.

Priority will be given to population sectors with risks to health or of social
exclusion.

Sport prescriptions will result in different physical activity programmes
according to participants’ risk level, local conditions and resources. Some
examples of projected programmes are:

Post-labour to ten months recovery programme: twice a week for both mother and
child (affective bond).

Healthy habits for people at risk from diabetes and obesity: two days per week
of physical activity.

Healthy walks around the park: twice a week.

Social programmes: two or three time a week according to sports facilities.

Health and sports promotion programmes: three days of out-of-school physical
activities in educational centres, as well as greater support for basic sports.

Active and healthy aging programmes: two or three times a week (for example, low
impact or adapted activities such as tai-chi or traditional games)." />
