	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Approval of a “Celiac Law”" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="With the aim of modernizing the obsolete legislation in the face of progress in
health sciences, we will start with the promulgation of a “Celiac Law”, because
celiac sufferers experience difficulties accessing to basic food as guaranteed
by the Spanish Constitution. We will fight against labour and school
discrimination in both public and private spheres against people whose illnesses
have successful treatment (celiac disease and diabetes).

This “Celiac Law” will be based on the following principles:

 * Researching, prevention, promotion and treatment related to Celiac Disease.
 * Creation and publication of a public list of gluten-free food, in order to
   avoid speculation and patronage; the identification and publication of these
   foods, with the seal of the Ministry of Health publically stating their
   origin.
 * Inclusion of the option of gluten-free foods in all Government actions
   related to food supplies.
 * Optimization of public health intervention strategies to guarantee a
   diagnosis and early treatment of the celiac disease as well as appropriate
   patient follow-up.
 * Elaboration of a guide of good medical practice published and distributed
   among all health workers. This guide will be checked and updated annually.
 * Promotion and encouragement of restaurants, bars and bakeries to make and
   sell gluten-free food.
 * Realization of periodical controls in order to detect celiac disease in
   school-age children.

Finally, we will study several funding aids orientated towards celiacs,
independent of age, based on population group (large family, unemployed and
people on non-contributory benefits, retired people, disabled people, groups at
risk of social exclusion) and according to the rules determined by the Ministry
of Health." />
